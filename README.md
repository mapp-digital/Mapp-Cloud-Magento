## Mapp Cloud Integration plugin for Magento 2

The Mapp Cloud Integration extension for Magento 2 enables customers to quickly and easily set up the tracking environment needed to start analysing website usage. It creates the data layer used to feed the Mapp Cloud tracking products. It helps customers to easily fuel the Mapp Intelligence customer insights dashboards with data, without requiring you to touch any code. Just get the extension, configure your Tag Integration ID and optionally the Tag Integration domain, and enable the plugin. For additional configuration and data collection it is possible to enable the Mapp Acquire pixel and use both pixels to unlock the full potential of the Mapp Cloud products.
The extension gives you access to more than 20 pre-configured dashboards to start analysing user behaviour right away. The dashboards are easily scalable and offer an abundant possibility to customize and extend the analyses. But Mapp Cloud products do not stop at collecting and analysing data: AI based segments support data-driven marketing decisions and increase revenue with predictive analytics to prevent churn and increase conversion rates.
The extension was developed for Magento v2.3.4 and upwards in combination with Mapp Cloud Tag Integration. (the corresponding pixel JS file and a Mapp Cloud account is needed in addition to the extension for Magento 2).
